                    Steve McCurry’s photographs are arresting—they seize the eye and detain your gaze—and the opulent, oversized (26.7 x 37cm) book from Taschen, a 256-page retrospective of his photos taken in Afghanistan, makes this abundantly clear
                    What is less evident, once the viewer is released and allowed to reflect, is what makes McCurry’s images in Afghanistan so compelling. After all, viewed from a cooler distance, the collection of images is a bit too conservative for its own good; a mixture of portraits, landscapes and scenes so balanced in their composition as to appear staged or painted..<br></br>
                    This, of course, touches on the thorny issue of authenticity; McCurry has been criticized for digitally manipulating several of his iconic images.
